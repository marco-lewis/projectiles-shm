# Projectiles and SHM (Archived)
Background: This was my A-level project I made in 2016. I haven't made many changes to it since then.

Language: Visual Basic

Program: Users can input initial values for vaious simulations that can be run, most notably projectile motion and
simple harmonic motion (SHM). Force arrows are displayed to show the forces that affect the objects.
Variables can also be saved and loaded to quickly access specific cases.

If using Visual Studio 2017, the code is visible in the Form1.vb file (accessed from the file directly or in the
solution explorer by right-clicking the Form1.vb and selecting View Code).
